### A MongoDB-based Flask Application
- In this case we're going to do an application factory with Blueprints
- Clone the app
  - Note that I'm using different container names in docker-compose.yml to avoid conflicts
- Build the image with `docker-compose build`
- Run the container with `docker-compose up`
- Hit `/` and see the counter incrementing every time you refresh the page
- To explore the mongodb database, open a new tab and do `docker exec -it counterapp_db_2 mongo`
  - Do `use counter`, `show collections`, `db.counter.find()`
- To run tests, do `docker exec -it counterapp_web_2 python tests.py`
- Using PDB with Docker Compose
  - Start the database as it's own demon service: `docker-compose up -d db`
  - Now start the application with pdb enabled: `docker-compose run --service-ports web`
  - You will get the live log of just the app and you can stop with CTRL-C
  - Try adding a pdb on the code
  - To stop the db `docker-compose stop db`
